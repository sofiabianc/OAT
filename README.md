# The ERC-20 Standard OAT token 

The OAT token is the native ERC-20 standard token to the Of All Trades platform which will be expended for a variety of investing education use-cases.
In time, this token will allows you to stake and earn token rewards in accordance with the success of the portfolios of users that you subscribe to, 
as well as can grant you access to exclusive content within your online investing community. We imagine users to have the ability to 
set a price for access to their followers-only content, and learn from eachother on how to become better investors in the process. 
In the future, the OAT platform will use its native token to reward users for their participation on the platform, as well as for contributing
quality content, as traced by the OAT upvoting protocol. 

The main functionality of the ERC-20 token is this: to allow users to send their OATs to other users.

# The "Upvote" minting protocol

The Upvoting smart contract will allow new ERC-20 standard OAT tokens to be minted into the ecosystem and placed into another 
user's account whenever a user "upvotes" another's post. Upvoting data gets traced to our backend, and allows us to keep track 
of whose posts are generating the most votes, most consistently. This will allow us to reward users who are posting quality content 
for three reasons... 

First: tokens will provide the user with the leverage to set a higher price to their followers-only content. 

Second: When, in the future, we allow the OAT token to be traded, the user will have higher volumes of OATs to trade. 

Third: The user will have greater amounts of tokens, which will allow them to stake or follow higher quality users on the platform 
(as recognized by their access-price and app ranking.)
