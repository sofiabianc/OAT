# The ERC-20 Standard OAT token 

The OAT token is the native ERC-20 standard token to the Of All Trades platform. Of All Trades is an investing education platform where users can share insightful content within their communities and learn from each other based on their investing experience, style of investing, and financial goals.

In time, the OAT token will allow you to earn token rewards based on both posting quality content and engaging with that content. Currently we are starting with earning tokens based on posting quality content only. This is implemented through the upvoting protocol, which rewards users for upvotes on their content on a 1:1 basis. In other words, users will receive one OAT token per upvote of their post. Future functionality will expand this rewards system to include additional inputs over time and allow users to send their OATs to other users to tip and subscribe to their content feeds.

# The "Upvote" minting protocol

The Upvoting smart contract will allow new ERC-20 standard OAT tokens to be minted into the ecosystem and placed into another
user's account whenever a user "upvotes" another's post. Upvoting data gets traced to our backend, and allows us to keep track
of whose posts are generating the most votes, most consistently. This will allow us to reward users who are posting quality content.

In the future, this may provide the content creators with leverage to set a higher price to their followers-only content. 

This is a dynamic price, unlimited supply token. In the future, if we allow the OAT token to be traded, the early users will have higher volumes of OATs to trade or at least greater amounts of tokens to leverage for other more advanced functionality such as staking portfolios or following high quality creators on the platform (as recognized by their access-price and app ranking).
