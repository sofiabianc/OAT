# The ERC-20 Standard OAT token 

The OAT token is the native ERC-20 standard token to the Of All Trades platform which will be expended for a variety of investing education use-cases.
In time, this token will allows you earn token rewards based on the quality of the content the user posts. This upvoting protocol rewards users being upvoted on a 1:1 basis for posting most valuable content based off of number of upvotes they recieve on their content. 

The main functionality of the ERC-20 token is this: to allow users to send their OATs to other users.

# The "Upvote" minting protocol

The Upvoting smart contract will allow new ERC-20 standard OAT tokens to be minted into the ecosystem and placed into another 
user's account whenever a user "upvotes" another's post. Upvoting data gets traced to our backend, and allows us to keep track 
of whose posts are generating the most votes, most consistently. This will allow us to reward users who are posting quality content 
for three reasons... 

First: tokens will provide the user with the leverage to set a higher price to their followers-only content. 

Second: When, in the future, we allow the OAT token to be traded, the user will have higher volumes of OATs to trade. 

Third: The user will have greater amounts of tokens, which will allow them to stake or follow higher quality users on the platform 
(as recognized by their access-price and app ranking.)
